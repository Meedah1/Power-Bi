RECOMMENDATION
I recommend that the sales team be appreciated for the increase in sales between 2013 and 2014 so as to encourage them to do more in the coming year.

Lagos and Ondo states should have their discounts revised as it takes more of their revenue.

Discounts should be revised for Oyo state so as to cover up their losses.

Stapler and Notepads have been returning losses, the discounts on these products should be revised and if the poor performance continues, their production should be discontinued entirely.

Midmarket and Channel partners are making losses greater than their sales and so their activities should be looked into or we could stop partnering with them.

More investments should be made in A4 paper as it has the possibility of overtaking Biro as our new performance Driver.
